## Code Explanation

### HTML

The HTML code is relatively straightforward and uses standard HTML elements. Here are some key points to note:

- The `<nav>` element contains the navigation bar with links to different sections of the website.
- The `<main>` element contains the main content of the website, including the blog posts, about me section, and contact form.
- The `<footer>` element contains the copyright information.

### CSS

The CSS code uses flexbox and media queries to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Here are some key points to note:

- The `body` element has a `font-family` of "Arial", which is a common sans-serif font.
- The `h1` elements use the `font-weight` property to make them bold
